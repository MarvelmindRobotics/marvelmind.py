Notes about using the example: <br />
1. You should achieve a good tracking before using the example. <br />
Please refer to operating manual for details: [https://marvelmind.com/pics/marvelmind_navigation_system_manual.pdf](https://marvelmind.com/pics/marvelmind_navigation_system_manual.pdf) <br />
2. When you finish build the map, you can: <br/>
2.1. If you want to get location and other data via mobile beacon, disconnect modem from the PC and connect to any USB charger. 
Then you can connect a mobile beacon to the PC for receiving data. <br/>
2.2. If you want to get location data via the modem, keep it connected to the PC via USB.
3. You should close the dashboard on the PC where you run the example, because dashboard and the example can't share the serial port.


## Attributes: ##

**adr** - address of mobile beacon (from Dashboard) for data filtering. If it is None, every read data will be appended to buffer.

*Default value: None*


**tty** - serial port device name (physical or USB/virtual). It should be provided as an argument: 

  * /dev/ttyACM0 - typical for Linux

  * /dev/tty.usbmodem1451 - typical for Mac OS X


**baud** - baudrate. Should be match to baudrate of hedgehog-beacon

*Default value: 9600*


**maxvaluescount** - maximum count of measurements of coordinates stored in buffer

*Default value: 3*


**valuesUltrasoundPosition** - buffer of US measured data (address of device, x, y, z (meters), angle (1/10 degree), timestamp (seconds)): [adr, x, y, z, ang, timestamp]

**valuesImuRawData** - buffer of IMU raw measures (accelerometer, gyroscope, compass)

**valuesImuData** - buffer of IMU and US based measures (position, angular position (quaternion), velocities, accelerations): [x, y, z, qw, qx, qy, qz, vx, vy, vz, ax, ay, az, timestamp]


**debug** - debug flag which activate console output	

*Default value: False*


**pause** - pause flag. If True, class would not read serial data


**terminationRequired** - If True, thread would exit from main loop stop
